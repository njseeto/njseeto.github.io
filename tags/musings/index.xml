      <description>TL, DR;  Work: Spies, branches and an incident. Life: Housemates, algorithms and kindness.  Work things:  Final week of compliance work (hopefully). Using Mockito Spies at work to help partially mock methods on a class. Branch based vs Trunk based development. I want to dedicate a bit more space for this discussion, but I wanted to highlight the difficulty of chasing someone down to review changes. We primarily work in a trunk-based manner (which I thoroughly enjoy) but for this particulary story I have been working on, the team decided to go with a branch based style and to have one developer working on the story.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  The Future of CyberSecurity conference → I&amp;rsquo;ll write up a quick overview of the conference when I get time. Watched Mastering Chaos - A Netflix Guide to Microservices Played around with Cloudcraft Held an event at work involving high school students and the Mayor&amp;rsquo;s Fund for London Decommissioned an application that is no longer used. It&amp;rsquo;s super satisfying deleting code. Discussed the best practice for acccessing data from a database.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  Finished a feature that adds specific information at the point of object creation, rather than enriching the object later on in the pipeline. Sprint planning → we are looking at splitting a monolithic application across two teams. Server response times in US were super slow → Caching the slow to build data solved this. Continued AWS learning → EC2, security groups and Elastic Block Storage (EBS).</description>

      <description>TL, DR;  This article will cover a fortnights&amp;rsquo; worth of musings (nothing about work, all about my holiday). Australia is pretty darn great. Discovered some new fun places in Sydney → White Rabbit Gallery and Sappho Books. Channeled Thelma &amp;amp; Louise and drove the Great Ocean Road with a friend. Detoured from the Great Ocean Road and did a few hikes in the Grampians. Hikes included Mt Abrupt - Mud Dadjug, Lake Elizabeth and Griffiths Island.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  AWS Solutions Architect Certification study continues → databases are my weakness Encryption at rest: Research into encrypting data in S3 buckets and ran into the issues with preserving the &amp;lsquo;last modified date&amp;rsquo; metadata when running   aws s3 cp s3://encrypted-bucket s3://encrypted-bucket --recursive --sse  (any insight into this would be greatly appreciated).
 Completed stories to protect our application from XSS (reflected and stored).</description>

      <title>Not another blog</title>

      <description>What is this? A blog. Yes another blog.
It&amp;rsquo;s a place that I do not expect many people to deliberately seek out, stumble upon sure but not stay for long. The reason for this blog is a purely selfish one. This is a place to keep my musings and an easy way to direct people (mainly myself) to information.

What can you expect? To be perfectly honest - fairly irregular blog posts.</description>
