      <description>TL, DR; Super delayed week notes!
 Christmas in Riga Identity functions are cool Challenge assumptions  Work things:  Story challenged. Assumptions here were challenged, a team wanted us to implement some metrics that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. More on this later on. I was looking through a section of Java 8 in Action book about streams and discovered you can use methods at the point of instantiation.
public Supplier&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;Boolean, List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; supplier() { return () -&amp;gt; new HashMap&amp;lt;Boolean, List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&amp;gt;() {{ put(true, new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;()); put(false, new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;()); }}; } In this example, a Map is created with two empty lists, one with the key of true and another with the key of false - cool huh</description>

      <description>TL, DR;  Work: Cassandra, Compliance, Connecting the dots Life: Climate  Work things:  Mocks and stubs. Chatted about our Cassandra database. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations). Found out that sometimes you need to wait 24hrs after deleting an AWS S3 bucket before it is actually deleted from the console. We had a phantom alert, ie: an alert was going off even though the metrics and graphs all looked fine.</description>

      <description>TL, DR;  Work: Spies, branches and an incident. Life: Housemates, algorithms and kindness.  Work things:  Final week of compliance work (hopefully). Using Mockito Spies at work to help partially mock methods on a class. Branch based vs Trunk based development. I want to dedicate a bit more space for this discussion, but I wanted to highlight the difficulty of chasing someone down to review changes. We primarily work in a trunk-based manner (which I thoroughly enjoy) but for this particulary story I have been working on, the team decided to go with a branch based style and to have one developer working on the story.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  The Future of CyberSecurity conference → I&amp;rsquo;ll write up a quick overview of the conference when I get time. Watched Mastering Chaos - A Netflix Guide to Microservices Played around with Cloudcraft Held an event at work involving high school students and the Mayor&amp;rsquo;s Fund for London Decommissioned an application that is no longer used. It&amp;rsquo;s super satisfying deleting code. Discussed the best practice for acccessing data from a database.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  Finished a feature that adds specific information at the point of object creation, rather than enriching the object later on in the pipeline. Sprint planning → we are looking at splitting a monolithic application across two teams. Server response times in US were super slow → Caching the slow to build data solved this. Continued AWS learning → EC2, security groups and Elastic Block Storage (EBS).</description>

      <description>TL, DR;  This article will cover a fortnights&amp;rsquo; worth of musings (nothing about work, all about my holiday). Australia is pretty darn great. Discovered some new fun places in Sydney → White Rabbit Gallery and Sappho Books. Channeled Thelma &amp;amp; Louise and drove the Great Ocean Road with a friend. Detoured from the Great Ocean Road and did a few hikes in the Grampians. Hikes included Mt Abrupt - Mud Dadjug, Lake Elizabeth and Griffiths Island.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  AWS Solutions Architect Certification study continues → databases are my weakness Encryption at rest: Research into encrypting data in S3 buckets and ran into the issues with preserving the &amp;lsquo;last modified date&amp;rsquo; metadata when running   aws s3 cp s3://encrypted-bucket s3://encrypted-bucket --recursive --sse  (any insight into this would be greatly appreciated).
 Completed stories to protect our application from XSS (reflected and stored).</description>
