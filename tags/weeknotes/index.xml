      <description>TL, DR;  This article will cover a fortnights&amp;rsquo; worth of musings (nothing about work, all about my holiday). Australia is pretty darn great. Discovered some new fun places in Sydney &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; White Rabbit Gallery and Sappho Books. Channeled Thelma &amp;amp; Louise and drove the Great Ocean Road with a friend. Detoured from the Great Ocean Road and did a few hikes in the Grampians. Hikes included Mt Abrupt - Mud Dadjug, Lake Elizabeth and Griffiths Island.</description>

      <description>TL, DR; Work things:  AWS Solutions Architect Certification study continues → databases are my weakness Encryption at rest: Research into encrypting data in S3 buckets and ran into the issues with preserving the &amp;lsquo;last modified date&amp;rsquo; metadata when running  aws s3 cp s3://encrypted-bucket s3://encrypted-bucket --recursive --sse (any insight into this would be greatly appreciated).
 Completed stories to protect our application from XSS (reflected and stored). Carried on building a SSH monitoring application in Python.</description>
