      <description>UPDATE
Criteria for this visa has recently changed. Therefore, not everything in this post may be applicable to your case.
Please refrain from asking me about your application. I am not an immigration lawyer and cannot legally advise anyone. This is not legal advice. This comprises general information and my personal experience with the visa.
A little background, I have been living in London since May 2016. I came in on the Youth Mobility visa, which gave me 2 years.</description>
