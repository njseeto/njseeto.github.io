      <description>Warning: This article contains references to emotions and feelings ðŸ˜Š Having an open conversation about mental health can be difficult to initiate. The invisible nature of mental health obscures our ability to determine whether someone is actually struggling. It either goes unnoticed or feels too awkward a topic to bring up.
While working as a clinician in children&amp;rsquo;s hospitals, I found myself in a number of hard discussions with families in distress.</description>

      <description>What is this? A blog. Yes another blog.
It&amp;rsquo;s a place that I do not expect many people to deliberately seek out, stumble upon sure but not stay for long. The reason for this blog is a purely selfish one. This is a place to keep my musings and an easy way to direct people (mainly myself) to information.

What can you expect? To be perfectly honest - fairly irregular blog posts.</description>
