<h3 id="tl-dr">TL, DR;</h3>

<ul>
<li>Work: Spies, branches and an incident.</li>
<li>Life: Housemates, algorithms and kindness.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="work-things">Work things:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Final week of compliance work (hopefully).</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/mockito-spy">Mockito Spies</a> at work to help partially mock methods on a class.</li>
<li>Branch based vs Trunk based development. I want to dedicate a bit more space for this discussion, but I wanted to highlight the difficulty of chasing someone down to review changes. We primarily work in a trunk-based manner (which I thoroughly enjoy) but for this particulary story I have been working on, the team decided to go with a branch based style and to have one developer working on the story. Without proper working agreements, pull requests and branches have been forgotten in a trunk-based world.</li>
<li>We had an incident at work, our servers were being spun up without the application present. This initially happened in the APAC region, then since none of those were funcitonal, the traffic was redirected to the US and EU regions. The new servers in these regions also did not have the application running causing a cascade of fresh hell. This was all because <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Welcome+to+Artifactory">Artifactory</a> access was locked, as the number of login tries was exceeded. This meant the applications could not be accessed and uploaded onto the new boxes. In our post-incident retro, we spoke about possible resolutions including removing the limit to unsuccessful password retries.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="general-life-things">General life things:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Caught up with my fellow bootcampers from <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders &amp; Coders</a>.</li>
<li>Caught up with a friend who has recently moved here from Sydney.</li>
<li>Looking for a housemate!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="message-of-the-week">Message of the week</h3>

<p>If someone reaches out, respond with kindness - seems like a no brainer but I often wonder if I do this enough.</p>

<p>Anecdote for these thinkings&hellip;. I was speaking to a friend, I wouldn&rsquo;t say she is a close friend but I can see us being close in the future. It was a brief interaction but she spoke to me about how the last few weeks had been tough for her. We were in a pub, she was on the verge of tears, we were surrounded by people we knew and I was panicking.</p>

<p>I am not very good with responding to emotions in a public space around people I know. I did of course listen to her, affirm her feelings and give her a hug / hold her hand but I never think I do enough in these situations. This interaction was playing on my mind that night - I stayed up for hours. I contacted her the next day and reminded her of all the great things she had done and then asked her to be kind to herself. To which she responded with, &lsquo;I really needed to hear this, thank you.&rsquo; So my message for myself is to &lsquo;be kind to yourself&rsquo; (if someone else is reading this, this message is for you too).</p>

<h3 id="who-taught-me-something-or-really-made-me-think-this-week">Who taught me something or really made me think this week?</h3>

<p>The different ways people deal with grief.</p>

<p>The reason us bootcampers met up was one of rememberance.
It had been over a year since I had seen my fellow coding pals and to come together for such a sombre occassion made me feel a little more anxious about showing up. I always second guess myself in social settings, &lsquo;What should I say next?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How should I act?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Why does this person think I am interesting?&rsquo;. Funnily enough, I would much rather show up to an event where I know no-one than to an event where I know people on surface level. I think it&rsquo;s because with strangers there is no preconceived expectations of how I should act or what I should say so I&rsquo;m like a blank canvas. Anyway, I digress.</p>

<p>What I really wanted to highlight was that there was a wonderful turn out for the event, a testiment to the FAC community. I was also surprised to see many faces not there, but then reminded myself that people deal with grief in many different ways.</p>

<h3 id="what-am-i-trying-to-work-out">What am I trying to work out?</h3>

<p>I want to be better at algorithms and data structures. I have the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms">Grokking Algorithms</a> book but need to make the time to go through it. I guess I&rsquo;m trying to work out how to be better with focussing on one thing at a time rather than wanting to learn everything at once.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-be-better-next-week">How can I be better next week?</h3>

<p>I really want to make a start on the algorithm book so doing at least one exercise from that book and write up notes as I go.</p>

<h3 id="what-am-i-looking-forward-to-next-week">What am I looking forward to next week?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Finalising a housemate (hopefully).</li>
<li>I am primary on call next week so am (wishfully) looking forward to not being woken up in the middle of the night.</li>
</ul>
